- Ensure content is publicly accessible (not behind login)

### "How do I know if AI browsers can see my content?"
- Test with Perplexity: Search for "[your topic] site:themotherhoodanthology.com"
- Check robots.txt is accessible: themotherhoodanthology.com/robots.txt
- Verify content isn't in images - must be real HTML text
