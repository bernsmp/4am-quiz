Insert this code after line 23 (inside the header section):
```html
<img src="YOUR_LOGO_URL_HERE" alt="Company Logo" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
```

### Add Social Media Links
Add this before the footer (around line 185):
```html
<tr>
    <td style="padding: 20px 40px; text-align: center;">
        <a href="YOUR_FACEBOOK_URL" style="margin: 0 10px;">
            <img src="FACEBOOK_ICON_URL" alt="Facebook" style="width: 24px; height: 24px;">
        </a>
        <a href="YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL" style="margin: 0 10px;">

## Profile Type Display Names

If you want to show friendlier names instead of the raw profile values, you can use GHL's conditional logic:

**Current raw values:**
- `google_winner`
- `ai_darling`
- `balanced_operator`
- `invisible_expert`

**Friendly display names suggestion:**
- Google Winner â†’ "SEO Champion"
- AI Darling â†’ "AI Visibility Leader"
- Balanced Operator â†’ "Balanced Performer"
- Invisible Expert â†’ "Hidden Gem"

To implement, you'll need to create conditional content in GHL based on the profile_type custom field value.

---

## Gap Type Display Logic

**Gap types:**
- `overconfident` - Quiz prediction was higher than actual performance
- `underconfident` - Quiz prediction was lower than actual performance
- `accurate` - Quiz prediction matched actual performance closely

You could add conditional messaging:
```
If gap_type = "overconfident":
"You're more optimistic than your current data shows - let's close that gap!"

If gap_type = "underconfident":
"Great news! You're performing better than you think!"

If gap_type = "accurate":
"You have a great understanding of your current visibility!"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Tags Not Populating?
- Verify custom fields are created in GHL with exact names
- Check that hidden fields on the form match the custom field names
- Ensure URL parameters are being passed correctly

### Email Not Sending?
- Check workflow is active
- Verify trigger is set to correct form
- Check GHL email sending limits/quotas
- Review workflow logs for errors

### Dashboard Link Not Working?
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable is set correctly
- Test the report_url custom field value in GHL
- Check that reportId is being passed through correctly

### Email Looks Broken?
- Test in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Some email clients strip certain CSS - the template uses inline styles for best compatibility
- Use GHL's "Send Test Email" feature before going live

## Email Marketing Best Practices

### Subject Line Tips:
- Current: `Your AI Visibility Report is Ready! ðŸŽ¯`
- Alternative 1: `[NAME], Your Search Visibility Report is Inside`
- Alternative 2: `See How AI Views Your Brand (Quiz Results)`
- Alternative 3: `Your Gap Analysis Score: [TOTAL_GAP] Points`

### Timing Recommendations:
- **Immediate**: Best for maintaining momentum (recommended)
- **5-minute delay**: Allows user to reach dashboard first, then get email for future reference
- **1-hour delay**: Can include follow-up content if they haven't viewed yet

### Deliverability Tips:
- Use a verified sending domain
- Avoid spam trigger words
- Keep images optimized (under 1MB total)
- Include plain text version (GHL can auto-generate)
- Add unsubscribe link (GHL adds automatically)

## Follow-Up Sequence Ideas

Consider creating additional automated emails:

1. **Day 1** (This email): Report delivery with dashboard link
2. **Day 3**: "Did you check your report? Here's what it means..."
3. **Day 7**: "Ready to close your gaps? Here's how we can help"
4. **Day 14**: Case study or success story
5. **Day 30**: "Schedule your strategy call" reminder
