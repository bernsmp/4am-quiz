# Quiz Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
Set up the quiz page that was pasted into the chat. The file needs to be properly saved and verified.

## Tasks

### 1. Save the quiz page component
- [ ] Create/save src/app/quiz/page.tsx with the quiz component code
- [ ] Verify all required UI components are available (button, card, progress, badge)
- [ ] Check imports and component dependencies

### 2. Test the implementation
- [ ] Run the development server
- [ ] Navigate to /quiz route
- [ ] Verify the quiz loads without errors
- [ ] Test quiz functionality (answering questions, navigation, results)

### 3. Security & quality checks
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Check that routing to /analysis page works
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on mobile

## Notes
- All required shadcn/ui components appear to be installed (badge, button, card, progress)
- The quiz uses client-side state management (no backend needed)
- Routes to /analysis page after completion

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create/save src/app/quiz/page.tsx with the quiz component code
- [x] Verify all required UI components are available (button, card, progress, badge)
- [x] Check imports and component dependencies
- [x] Run the development server
- [x] Navigate to /quiz route
- [x] Verify the quiz loads without errors
- [x] Verify no hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [x] Check that routing to /analysis page works
- [x] Ensure responsive design works on mobile

## Review

### Summary of Changes
- Replaced quiz questions in `src/app/quiz/page.tsx` with new personality-driven questions
- Updated quiz from generic SEO/AEO questions to more engaging "party personality" style questions
- Changed scoring logic to use percentages instead of raw scores
- Updated profile analysis descriptions with more direct, punchy language

### New Questions Added
1. "If your content was a person at a party..."
2. "When someone wants to verify you're credible..."
3. "Your content structure is mostly..."
4. "In the last 30 days, how many people have said 'I found you on Google'?"
5. "If I visit your site and click 'View Page Source'..."
6. "When you publish content, you..."
7. "If I look at your article's code, would I find special tags..."
8. "How do you prove your expertise?"

### Technical Details
- All required shadcn/ui components already installed (no new dependencies)
- Quiz uses client-side React state management
- Routes to `/analysis` page after completion
- Retake quiz functionality uses `window.location.reload()`
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3006

### Dependencies
No new dependencies added - all components were already in the project:
- @radix-ui/react-progress
- @radix-ui/react-slot
- lucide-react
- next
- react

### Environment Variables
No environment variables needed - all logic is client-side.

### Security
- ✅ No API keys or secrets in code
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ All calculations happen client-side
- ✅ Proper routing with Next.js useRouter

### Known Limitations & Future Improvements
- Quiz results are not persisted (no database/localStorage)
- No analytics tracking on quiz completions
- Could add email capture before showing results
- Could add social sharing of results
- "Retake Quiz" uses full page reload instead of state reset

### Testing
- ✅ Dev server starts successfully
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ /analysis page exists and is accessible
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No build errors
