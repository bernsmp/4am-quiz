## Task
Add a centered "TAKE THE QUIZ" button to the home page under the "Zero-Click Search" section.

## Plan

- [x] Position it under "That's not a future problem. Zero-Click Search is happening RIGHT NOW â€” whether you realize it or not."
- [x] Center the button
- [x] Use the same green styling as other CTAs on the page
- [x] Link to /quiz page

## Changes Made
- Added centered "TAKE THE QUIZ" button in src/app/page.tsx at line 175
- Button appears at the end of the "Zero-Click Search" section
- Uses same green ShimmerButton styling as other CTAs
- Links to /quiz page
- Added margin-top of 12 units for proper spacing

## Summary
The button is now live and appears between the Zero-Click Search section and the Good News section, providing a clear call-to-action after the urgency-building content.
